## SAINT SYLVESTER, BISHOP OF ROME

Born in Rome and educated from youth in worldly wisdom and the faith of Christ. He always directed his life according to the commandments of the Gospel. He greatly benefited from the teachings of the priest Timothy, whose martyrdom for the faith he also witnessed, and observing the example of his teacher's heroic sacrifice, he himself was imbued with such a spirit for his entire life. At the age of 30, he became the bishop of Rome. He corrected the customs of Christians. For example, he abolished the fast every Saturday, as was previously held by some Christians, and decreed that fasting should only occur on Great Saturday and those Saturdays that coincide with fasts. With his prayers and miracles, he helped Emperor Constantine and his mother Helena to convert to the true faith and be baptized. He assisted Queen Helena in finding the True Cross. He governed the Church of God for 20 years and peacefully ended his earthly life, transferring to the Kingdom of Heaven.

## THE VENERABLE SERAPHIM OF SAROV

St. Seraphim was one of the greatest Russian ascetics, clairvoyants, and miracle-workers. Born in 1759, he passed away in 1833. He was distinguished by great humility. When the whole world celebrated him, he referred to himself as "Wretched Seraphim."

## SAINT THEODOTA

St. Theodota, the mother of the holy brothers Cosmas and Damian, the unmercenary physicians and miracle-workers. She lived a godly life and directed her sons to lead such a life as well.

## THE VENERABLE AMMON

St. Ammon was a great ascetic of the 5th century. He was the abbot of the monastery of Tabennisi in Upper Egypt. Under his guidance, around three thousand monks practiced asceticism. He possessed the grace-filled gift of miracles and clairvoyance. When a monk asked him for advice, he said: "Be like a convict in prison, and just as he constantly asks: when will the judge come?, so you should also ask with fear."

## HYMN OF PRAISE
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
SAINT SYLVESTER
</div>

>O Lord, most wonderful, wonderful in Your saints, You are;  
Mighty and Merciful, through Your saints, You appear.  
Like the sun through stars, You shine through the saints,
Granting strength to the humble, exalting them in Heaven.

You share wisdom with the simple, shaming the wise,
You bless the poor with abundance, nourishing the hungry with Heaven.
You possess saints of every kind,
From every age, You accept them into Your fold, from every bloodline.

Without caste, without distinction: whether last or first,
Pure from sins, and they thrive in goodness,
Noble souls, akin to Your Christ,
You call them saints. And You summon each one
To be a saint. Resonating, cleansing,
Cleansing from sin, like wool white,
All heavens rejoice with You in such. Sylvester would be such,
You delight in him, sharing blessings for his sake and ours.


## REFLECTION

How do you respond to those who say that Christ the Miracle-worker cannot fit into our logic? Simply reply: Fit yourself into His logic. In His logic, all eternity fits and all the nobleness of time—and so, if you wish, a place will be found even for you. If a barrel cannot fit into a thimble, you can fit a thimble into a barrel. Blessed Clement of Alexandria says: "Philosophers are children until they become men through Christ. For truth is never merely thinking."

Christ came to correct man and, therefore, man's logic. He is our Logos and our Logic. That is why we must direct our reason toward Him and not Him toward our reason. He is the One Who corrects our reason. The sun is not regulated according to our clock, but our clock is regulated according to the sun.


## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the Lord Jesus Christ as the Divine Word (Logos):

1. He, the Triune God, created all things by His Word, that is by the Lord Christ.

2. The senselessness of every person who distances themselves from Christ, the Word of God, becoming lifeless, devoid of Christ.

on haughtiness

*"Pride goes before disaster, and a haughty spirit before a fall"* (Proverbs 16:18)
</div>
Of all things in the four corners of the world, what can make us mortal beings haughty except foolishness and demonic deception? Did we not come into this world naked and destitute, and shall we not depart from it in the same manner? Everything we possess, have we not borrowed, and shall we not have to return it all with death? Ah, how many times has this been said and yet ignored! We brought nothing into this world, and therefore we cannot take anything out of it (1 Timothy 6:7), says the wise apostle. And when we offer a sacrifice to God, simple bread and wine, we say: We offer to You what is Yours from Your own!, for we have nothing in this world that is truly ours: not a morsel of bread, not a drop of wine — nothing that is not from God. Truly, haughtiness is the daughter of folly, born of a mind darkened, conceived in a wicked alliance with demons.

Haughtiness is a wide window through which all our virtues and good deeds quickly dissipate. Nothing renders us more empty before people and more unworthy before God than haughtiness. If the Lord is not haughty, how can we be? Who has more right to be haughty than the Lord, who created the world and sustains it with His power? And behold, He humbled Himself to become a servant, a servant to the whole world; to death, death on the cross!

O Lord of humility, burn with the fire of Your Holy Spirit the devilish crop of haughtiness in our hearts, and plant in us the noble crop of humility and meekness. 

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

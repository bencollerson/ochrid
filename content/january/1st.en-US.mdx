## THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD AND GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

On the eighth day after His birth, the Divine Infant was brought into the temple and circumcised according to the law existing in Israel since the time of Abraham. On this occasion, He was given the name Jesus, as announced by the Archangel Gabriel to the Most Holy Virgin. The Old Testament circumcision foreshadowed the New Testament baptism. The circumcision of our Lord demonstrates that He took upon Himself true human flesh, not merely apparent, as some heretics later taught about Him. Furthermore, our Lord underwent circumcision to fulfill the entire Law which He Himself gave through the prophets and patriarchs. Having fulfilled that written requirement of the Law, He replaced it with Baptism in His Church, as the Apostle declared: "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature" (Galatians 6:15). (In the liturgical observance of the Church, this Feast of the Lord's Circumcision has neither a Forefeast nor an Afterfeast).

## SAINT BASIL THE GREAT, ARCHBISHOP OF CAESAREA

Born during the reign of Emperor Constantine. Even before his baptism, he studied for fifteen years in Athens, learning philosophy, rhetoric, astronomy, and all other secular sciences of that time. His school companions were Gregory the Theologian and Julian, who later became an apostate emperor. In his later years, he was baptized in the Jordan River along with his former teacher, Ebulios. He served as the Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia for nearly ten years and passed away fifty years after his birth. Basil was a staunch advocate of Orthodoxy, a beacon of moral purity, fervent in his religious zeal, possessing a great theological intellect, and a significant builder and supporter of the Church of God.

Basil earned the title "Great" rightfully. In the liturgical service, he is referred to as the "bee of the Church of Christ," which provides honey to the faithful and stings the heretics with its stinger. Many works of this Church Father have been preserved, including theological, apologetic, ascetic, and canonical writings, as well as the Divine Liturgy named after him. This liturgy is celebrated ten times a year: on January 1st, his feast day; on the eve of Christmas; on the eve of Epiphany; every Sunday during Great Lent except Palm Sunday; on Great Thursday and Great Saturday. Saint Basil peacefully passed away on January 1, 379 AD, and entered into the Kingdom of Christ.

## HYMN OF PRAISE
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD AND GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST    
SAINT BASIL THE GREAT  
</div>

>You who gave the Law to both the world and man,  
You, Lawgiver, did subject Yourself to its span,  
While others by force, You, willingly, did bind,  
Thus on the eighth day, in flesh, You were confined.  

>In fulfilling the Law, You replaced it anew,  
The fleshly circumcision, with a spiritual view.  
To sever impure passions, from within our core,  
And in pure spirit, to behold You evermore.  

>To cut through the desires, by spiritâ€™s keen knife,  
To fulfill, O Savior, Your will in our life.  
To this circumcision, the saints did aspire,  
Leaving us their blaze, as a guiding fire.  

>O Basil, magnificent, like a radiant ray,  
Teaching through such circumcision, generations to sway.  
Glory to Basil, Your devoted servant true,  
Great, for in Your name, humble and contrite He grew.  

>Thus he became greater, and Great He remains,  


## RELFECTION

Why should one listen to the Church rather than a single person who thinks against the Church, even if he were to be considered the greatest thinker? Because the Church was founded by the Lord Jesus Christ, and because the Church is guided by the inspiring leadership of the Holy Spirit of God. Moreover, because the Church signifies the realm of the Holy, a garden of tame fruit trees. If someone rises against the realm of the Holy, it means that he is unholy, so why listen to him?

"The Church is an enclosure," says the wise John Chrysostom. "If you are inside, the wolf does not enter; but if you go out, the beasts will seize you... Do not distance yourself from the Church; there is nothing mightier than the Church. The Church is your hope, your salvation. It is higher than the heavens, harder than stone, wider than the world. It never grows old, and always renews itself."

## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the circumcision of the Lord Jesus:

1. His glory in the heavenly kingdom where the cherubim serve Him with fear and trembling,

2. His humiliation and humility in the act of circumcision, intended for sinners,

3. Contemplate my own heart: how much I have circumcised it from sinful thoughts, vices, and passions.

**on how to avoid evil and do good**
</div>
<br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Turn from evil, and do good"* (Psalm 34:14)
</div>
With these words, all our effort is expressed, the effort with which we should strive here on earth, both in the material realm and in this material body. So, what should be our effort? To acquire two habits: one - to depart from evil, and the other - to do good. And about what is good and what is evil, our conscience tells us partially and unclearly, because it is obscured by sin, while the teaching of Christ is complete and clear.

What does the Lord ask of us, brethren? He asks that just as our altars are always turned towards the East, so should our souls always be turned towards the good. To leave evil behind, in the shadows, in the abyss of forgetfulness, in the darkness of the past, and we, from year to year, from day to day, should reach out towards the good: to think about the good, to long for the good, to speak about the good, to do good. The Lord seeks builders, not destroyers. For whoever builds good, by that very act, destroys evil. But whoever turns to destroy evil quickly forgets to build good and becomes a criminal.

Hating evil, hold fast to good (Romans 12:9), teaches us the apostle of Christ. Hate evil, but do not hate the person who does evil, for he is sick. If you can, heal the sick, but do not kill him with your hatred. Hold fast to good, and only to good, for good is from God, and because God is the treasury of all goodness.

O Lord, good and benevolent, teach us to depart from evil and do good for Your glory and for our salvation.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## THE PROPHET MALACHI

Prophet Malachi. The last prophet in chronological order. He was born after the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity. He had an unusually beautiful appearance. According to tradition, the people called him an angel, perhaps because of his external beauty or because of his spiritual purity, or perhaps because of his friendship with the angel of God. He often spoke face to face with an angel.
When this happened, some others heard the voice of an angel, but they did not deign to see the angelic face. What the angel revealed to him, the young prophet prophesied. He cried out against the ungrateful Israel and the wicked priests. Five hundred years before Christ, he clearly predicted the appearance and ministry of John the Baptist. But mainly, he was a prophet of the Day of Judgment. He dedicated himself to God in his youth, and after him, there was no longer a prophet in Israel until John the Baptist.

## THE PRIEST-MARTYR GORDIUS

St. Martyr Gordius. Born in Caesarea in Cappadocia. He was an officer in the Roman army during the reign of Emperor Licinius. However, when a fierce persecution of Christians arose, he left the army and his rank and withdrew to the wilderness of Mount Sinai. Alone on Mount Horeb, Gordius spent his time in prayer and contemplation of the mysteries of heaven and earth. He particularly reflected on the vanity and emptiness of all that people struggle and fight for on earth, and finally desired to die and be transferred to the eternal and imperishable life. With this desire, he descended to the city during some pagan races and games. He declared himself a Christian to the city magistrate. In vain, the magistrate tried to turn him away from the faith, with flattery and threats. Gordius remained unshaken and firm as a diamond, saying, "Is it not plainly madness to buy with this short-lived life eternal torment and spiritual ruin?" Sentenced to death, he joyfully hastened to the place of execution and along the way, spoke to the executioners about the wonderful and sweet teaching of Christ. With the name of Jesus on his lips, he surrendered his young body to the sword and his righteous soul to God in the year 320.

## SAINT GENEVIEVE

St. Genevieve, the patroness of the city of Paris. Through fasting, prayer, and almsgiving, she was deemed worthy of the Kingdom of God and passed away on January 3, 512, at the age of 89.


## HYMN OF PRAISE
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>

**THE HOLY PROPHET MALACHI**
</div>

>Malachi reports what the angel says to him:
Day, day, oh day is coming! A day burning like an oven. Who will endure it? 
Who will stand before the Judge with their righteousness? 
All the wicked will be like dry stubble, food for the hungry fire. 
Weeping, sighing, and crying out! 
The fire overflows, and like a river it flows, what can the tongue of sinners say there? 
My priests, my dishonored ones, why does your tongue not sing the Lord's glory? 
You have become despised among the people everywhere, because you have despised my judgment, and the law, and miracles. 
I, the Lord, speak, the Lord of hosts, oh how heavy are the judgments to the detestable sorcerers! 
When the fire rushes forth, smoke, and a dreadful clamor, then the hand of the Lord will no longer show mercy. 
Repent, people, while there is still day, return to me, and I will return to you. I, the Lord, speak, the Lord of hosts: Return to me, and I will return to you. 
Malachi reports what the angel says: Day, day, oh day is coming! A day burning like an oven!

## REFLECTION

God allows humiliation and downfall to befall the arrogant person when they think that their power is forever secure. When the wicked Roman prefect Tarquinian beheaded the blessed Timothy, he summoned Saint Sylvester and threatened him with death if he did not reveal Timothy's remaining possessions and if he did not immediately offer a sacrifice to the idols. Fearlessly and without trembling, the insightful saint responded to him with the words of the Gospel: "You fool, tonight I will take your soul from you, and what you boast of, that you will impose on me (i.e., death), will happen to you." The arrogant prefect bound Sylvester in chains and threw him into prison with the intention of executing him soon. Having done so, he sat down to eat. But a fishbone stuck in his throat. From noon until midnight, doctors struggled to save his life, but all in vain. At midnight, Tarquinian breathed out his arrogant soul in the greatest agony. And thus, the prophecy of Saint Sylvester came true, as did the biblical word: arrogance comes before destruction (Proverbs 16:18).

## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate your guardian angel:

1. How he stands at my right side, supporting me until I forsake the law of God.

2. How many times I have offended him and driven him away from me, sinning against the law of God.

on how the Kingdom of God is gained by the heart and not by the tongue
</div>
<br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven"* (Matthew 7:21).
</div>
Brethren, the Kingdom of God is not won by the tongue, but by the heart. The heart is the treasury of that treasure by which the kingdom is purchased, the heart and not the tongue. If the treasury is full of the treasures of God, that is, strong faith, good hope, bright love, and good deeds, then its messenger, the tongue, is faithful and pleasant; but if the treasury is empty of all those treasures, then its messenger is false and bold. As the heart, so are the words. As the heart, so are the deeds. Everything depends on the heart.

Hypocrisy is powerless before people, even more powerless before God. If I am a father, says the Lord through the prophet Malachi, if I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? That is: I hear that you call me father, but I do not see that you honor me in your hearts. I hear that you call me master, but I do not see fear toward me in your hearts.

Our prayer: Lord! Lord! is beautiful and beneficial only when it springs from a praying heart. The Lord Himself commanded us to pray without ceasing, but not only with the tongue so that people may hear us, but shut in the closet of the heart, so that the Lord may hear and see us.

Lord of majesty and wonder, deliver us from hypocrisy and instill your fear in our hearts, so that our hearts may be constantly upright in prayer before You.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

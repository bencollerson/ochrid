## THE SYNAXIS <span style={{color:'crimson', fontSize:'80%'}}>[ASSEMBLY]</span> OF THE SEVENTY HOLY APOSTLES

The Assembly of the Holy Seventy Apostles. Besides the Twelve Great Apostles, the Lord also chose seventy others, lesser apostles, and sent them to preach the Gospel, sending them out two by two before His face into every city and place, saying, "Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves" (Luke 10:1–5). But just as one of the Twelve, Judas, fell away from the Lord, so did some of these Seventy forsake the Lord, not out of intentional betrayal but due to human weakness and lack of faith (John 6:66). And just as Judas' place was filled by another apostle, so were the places of these filled by other chosen ones. These apostles labored in the same work as the Twelve Great Apostles, assisting the Twelve in spreading and establishing the Church of God in the world. They endured many trials and persecutions from people and demons, but their steadfast faith and fervent love for the risen Lord made them conquerors of the world and heirs of the kingdom of heaven.

## EUSTATHIUS <span style={{color:'crimson', fontSize:'80%'}}>[JEVSTATIJE]</span>, ARCHBISHOP OF THE SERBS

Jevstatije, Archbishop of Serbia, was born in the Budimljan region to devout parents. As a young man, he entered monastic life in Zeta and later pursued a higher calling in Hilandar Monastery. Over time, he became the abbot of Hilandar and was eventually chosen as the bishop of Zeta, and later as the Archbishop of Serbia. He was a man of great virtue and zealously tended to the flock of Christ with love and dedication. He peacefully reposed in 1279, exclaiming before his death, "Into Your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit!" His relics rest beneath the vault of the Peć Patriarchate.

## THE EUNUCH OF QUEEN CANDACE

The eunuch of Queen Candace was baptized by the Apostle Philip (Acts 8:26-40). After his baptism, the eunuch returned home and began to preach about Christ. He was among the first apostles of faith among the Ethiopians. He died a martyr's death and was deemed worthy of the kingdom of God.

## THE VENERABLE MARTYR ONUPHRIUS OF HILANDAR MONASTERY <span style={{color:'crimson', fontSize:'80%'}}>[MOUNT ATHOS]</span>

St. Onuphrius of Hilandar was angered at his parents in his youth and declared to the Turks that he would convert to Islam. Immediately after this, he repented of his words, went to Hilandar, and became a monk. With the blessing of his spiritual father, he resolved to endure martyrdom. Therefore, he went to Trnovo, where he presented himself to the Turks, declared himself a Christian, insulted Muhammad, and was beheaded on January 4, 1818, at the age of 32. The body of this spiritual knight was not preserved, as the Turks threw it into the sea.


## HYMN OF PRAISE
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
THE SEVENTY HOLY APOSTLES
</div>

>O knights of the Cross, sons of light,  
You have not yet passed, children of the future,  
For you are not dead, as Christ is not,  
But alive with a life that never decays.  
The Lord crowned you with splendor,  
As you proclaimed His holy name loudly  
Before kings and princes, before dreadful executioners.  
You served God—suffering was your worldly reward,  
You walked after Christ, oh Christ's bees!  
You filled the world with honey, filled the vessels!  
You eased souls, calmed passions,  
With Christ's fragrance you perfumed the earth,  
You became salt and light to the world, and incense to it.  
Seventy others, all with the same love,  
Like branches with the tree, all united with Christ;  
Seventy stars around the Sun—Christ,  
And there are angels, and the Pure Virgin,  
There is unspeakable delight, unseen joy,  
Of the victorious ones over passing time.  
Holy Apostles, glory and praise to you,  
From your blood righteousness blossomed.  

## REFLECTION

God hears the prayers of the righteous. This is clearly evident from the lives of Moses and Elijah and other righteous prophets of the Old Testament, as well as from the lives of the apostles and saints. When St. Genevieve, as a nun, practiced asceticism in Paris, it happened that Attila with his wild Huns surrounded Paris. Fear and horror seized all the inhabitants of Paris who expected the enemy to conquer the city at any moment. Then St. Genevieve called on the people to fast and pray to God, promising that disaster would be averted. Many men and women responded to the call of this saint and began to fast and pray. Genevieve herself fasted the most and prayed most earnestly to God. After a short time, the enemy turned away from Paris, without any visible reason, and went to another side. What the sword of many sinners cannot accomplish, the prayer of one righteous person can.


## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the richness of God's power, wisdom, and love, namely:

1. The wealth of that power, wisdom, and love, revealed in the created nature,

2. The wealth of that power, wisdom, and love, disclosed to the world through the Lord Jesus Christ.

*"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world"* (John 17:16)
</div>
Christ the Lord is not of this world but only in the attire of this world. He is a prince, dressed as a servant, to save the enslaved by sin, matter, and Satan. And just as the prince is, so are his soldiers. And they are not of this world by spirit: they are not slaves but free, not servants but masters, not perishable but immortal, not lost but saved. Such are all those whom Christ recruited and who, having tasted immortal life, willingly renounced the world and joined Him, remaining faithful to Him until the end of their lives on earth. Moses said to his father: "No one can join Christ's army unless he is wholly like fire, and despises honors and rest, and cuts off all bodily desires, and observes all God's commandments." Judas would also have been recruited, but he fell away and preferred the prison to the royal court, slavery to freedom, decay to immortality, and destruction to salvation. But the other apostolic recruits, both great and small, remained faithful to Him until the end and achieved victory, which glorified them on earth among men and in heaven among angels. Therefore, they are glorified and blessed on earth and in heaven. All who glorified themselves with the world perished with the world, but those who glorified themselves with Christ were saved by Christ. The glory of the world is death, but the glory of Christ is life, eternal life that never dies.

Lord immortal, though we are from the world by body and sin, recruit us into Your army, which is not of the world by spirit, by power, by wisdom, and by love. So that even when we die to the world, we may live in Your immortal kingdom, with angels, apostles, and saints. Because of the love and prayers of Your holy apostles. To You be glory and praise forever. Amen.

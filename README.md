The Prologue from Ochrid has been available for reading free online for many years.
This open source project seeks to amplify the reach of the Prologue to all Orthodox Christians and inquirers of Holy Orthodoxy.

This project will benefit from your good-hearted contributions!

Through the prayers of St. Nikolai of Ohrid and Zhicha and Blessed Seraphim of Platina, may God have mercy on us and save us!

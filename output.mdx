1. THE THEOPHANY [EPIPHANY] OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST  
When our Lord reached thirty years from His physical birth, He began His teaching and salvific work. He Himself signified this "beginning of the beginning" by His baptism in the Jordan River. St. Cyril of Jerusalem says: "The beginning of the world is water; the beginning of the Gospel is the Jordan." At the time of the Baptism of the Lord in water, the mystery was declared to the world--the mystery that was prophesied in the Old Testament; the mystery that was known only in fables in ancient Egypt and India--the mystery of the Divine Holy Trinity. The Father was revealed to the sense of hearing, the Spirit was revealed to the sense of sight, and the Son was revealed to the sense of touch. The Father uttered His witness about the Son, the Son was baptized in the water, and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove hovered above the water. When John the Baptist bore witness to Christ, saying: Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world (John 1:29), and when John immersed and baptized the Lord in the Jordan, the mission of Christ in the world and the path of our salvation were shown. That is to say, the Lord took upon Himself the sins of mankind and died under them (immersion) and rose again (the coming out of the water); and we must die to the old sinful man and rise again as cleansed, renewed and regenerated. This is the Savior and this is the path of salvation. The Feast of the Theophany is also called the Feast of Illumination. The event in the Jordan River illuminates us by manifesting God to us as Trinity, consubstantial and undivided. That is one way that we are illumined. And the second way is that every one of us through baptism in water is illumined, in that we become adopted by the Father of Lights through the merits of the Son and the power of the Holy Spirit.

THE HOLY TRINITY

O Holy Lord, holy in creating:

All that Thou makest by Thy Word, Thou doest consecrate by the Spirit.

O Mighty Lord, mighty in suffering:

For the sake of the world Thou goest to Thy death; for the sake of the world Thou dost resurrect.

O Immortal Lord, with our voices we hymn Thee:

Father, Son, Holy Spirit--God, have mercy on us!

The Father, Who appeared over Jordan as a Voice;

The Spirit, Who hovered as a milk-white Dove;

The Son, Who by the Prophet John was baptized:

Three rays of Light, one Light shone.

O Trinity manifested, with our voices we hymn Thee:

Father, Son, Holy Spirit--God, have mercy on us!


REFLECTION

At one time the fables of the heretics plagued the Church of God, and now the Church is plagued by the fables of the apostates from God. By perseverance in the Faith, by diligence in prayer, by confession of the Faith, and even by martyrdom for the Faith, the Church has remained undefeated. Only by these methods will these new plagues be defeated. The Church of God, the Vessel of Divine Truth, will triumph in the end: The swords of the enemy have utterly failed (Psalm 9:6). Blessed Clement of Alexandria, speaking about heretics who left the Church, said: "He who has fallen into heresy travels through an arid desert, abandoning the One True God. Alienated from God, he seeks water in dry places, he gathers barren fruit with his hands, and enters into an uninhabited and thirsty land." This also can be said today about the many theoreticians and inventors of scientific hypotheses who are led by their imaginations and not by the truth of God.


## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the event of the Baptism of the Lord:


1. His humble coming to the Jordan River, unknown to all except John;


2. His immersion in the water, the hovering of the Dove over Him, and the Voice from on High.

on the mystery of the Divine Trinity

"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit and the water and the blood: and these three are together" (I John 5: 7-8).

When we read Holy Scripture, we should be alert to keep an eye on every word. To the rapid reader, for example, this distinction which the Evangelist draws between the Heavenly Trinity and the earthly trinity will not become apparent. Concerning the Heavenly Trinity, he says, and these three are one; and concerning the earthly trinity, he says, and these three are together. There is an enormous difference between "being one" and "being together." The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are One, whereas the spirit, the water and the blood are only together and are not one. Even enemies could be together, but are not one. All the people on earth are together, but they are not one. Water and blood constitute the body, and the spirit is the spirit. For the flesh has desires against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh (Galatians 5:17). They are not one, but they are still together. When man dies, the union is broken and ceases to exist. Blood and water go to one side, and the spirit goes to another side. However, the Persons of the Divine Trinity in the heavens are not only together, but They are also One.

There is also another trinity in the inner heaven of man which should be not only a unity but a oneness, so that man may be blessed in this world and in the other world. That is the union of the mind, heart and will. As long as these three are only in togetherness, man will be at war with himself and with the Heavenly Trinity. However, when these three become one, so that none rules and none is enslaved, then man becomes filled with the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding (Philippians 4:7), that surpasses man's every word, every explanation, every fear and every sorrow. Then the small heaven in man begins to resemble that great heaven of God, and the "image and likeness of God" become apparent in man.

O Triune God, help us to at least resemble those who resemble Thee.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

1. SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST

Because John's main role in his life was played out on the day of the Theophany (Epiphany), the Church has from earliest times dedicated the day following Theophany to his memory. An incident with the hand of the Forerunner is also linked to this feast. The Evangelist Luke desired to remove the body of John from Sebaste, where the great prophet was beheaded by Herod, to Antioch, his place of birth. He succeeded, though, in acquiring and translating only one hand, which was preserved in Antioch until the tenth century. After this it was transferred to Constantinople, where it disappeared during the time of the Turks.

Feasts of St. John are celebrated several times throughout the year, but this day, January 7, has the most Sveƒçara.*) Among the Gospel personalities who surround the Savior, John the Baptist occupies a totally unique place by the manner of his entry into the world, and by the manner of his life in this world; by his role in baptizing people for repentance; by his baptizing the Messiah; and, finally, by his tragic departure from this life. He was of such moral purity that, in truth, he could be called an angel--as Holy Scripture calls him--rather than a mortal man. St. John especially differs from all other prophets in that he had that privilege of being able, with his hand, to show the world Him about Whom he prophesied.

It is said that every year on the feast of the saint, the bishop brought the hand of St. John before the people. Sometimes the hand appeared open and other times the hand appeared clenched. In the first case it signified a fruitful and bountiful year, and in the second case it meant a year of unfruitfulness and famine.

2. THE HOLY MARTYR ATHANASIUS

This martyr of Christ was a man simple and poor, but rich in faith and wise through the Spirit of God. Once, Athanasius unintentionally entered into a debate about the Faith with a certain Turk. The Turk was educated and adroit with words, but Athanasius endeavored with all his strength to emphasize and establish the truth of the Christian Faith and its superiority over Islam. After that they departed. The next day Athanasius was summoned before the judge. This Turk stood there as his accuser. When the judge called upon Athanasius to deny the Faith of Christ, as he had supposedly done before his companion the previous day, and to embrace Islam, Athanasius cried out: "I would rather die a thousand deaths than renounce the Faith of Christ." For this, he was condemned to death and beheaded in the year 1700 A.D., in Smyrna. His body was buried in the Church of St. Parasceva in the same city.

SAINT JOHN THE FORERUNNER AND BAPTIST

Thirty years of fasting and silence--

This, not even the mountain beasts can endure!

The lion alleviates his hunger with the music of roaring,

And the tree rustles when the wind approaches.

But you neither rustle, nor moan.

Neither your lament nor your song through the wilderness echoes!

Tell me, are you a man? What is your name?

Will you ever want to speak with someone?

"The voice, the voice, the voice: I am the voice--

But the Word of God, He is.

To the children of Israel I was sent to cry out:

Repent, O people; behold, He comes.

Bring forth good fruit, each according to your strength.

Behold, behold He comes--oh, wonder of wonders!

In the midst of the water, fire from heaven is concealed!

Behold, the Lamb of God, among the wolves, walks.

Wolves, your lupine temper in the water, cleanse!"

Thirty years of silence and fasting:

Of your body, what remains, save your voice?

Your withered body is but a shadow of your voice,

Which proclaims the news: Behold, God is come to us!

Your withered body was a reed, which Herod broke.

But the voice goes on and on, with no one to silence it.

Whose voice is that, at which even the centuries tremble?

A hungry lion! No, No--a man of faith.


RELFECTION


St. Basil the Great said: "Man is not something visible." Just as one house resembles another, so the outward appearance of one man resembles that of another. To the house is given honor according to the one who dwells in the house; so it is with man, according to the spirit that dwells in him. To the bodily sight, it is obvious that the house is not the master, but just a house in which the master dwells; but only to the spiritual sight is it obvious that the body is not the man, but only the house in which the man dwells.


## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the departure of the Lord to the Mount of Temptation:


1. How, after His baptism, He immediately directs Himself to fasting and to prayer;


2. How, for a baptized man, the devil works his wile especially during the time of fasting and of prayer;


3. How He--meek as a lamb, yet decisively, as the Master--rejects all the temptations of the devil.

on submission to the will of God

"Thy will be done, in earth as in heaven" (Matthew 6:10).

Blessed be John the Baptist, for he fulfilled the Gospel before the arrival of the Gospel! Going into the wilderness, he gave himself up completely to the will of God, both body and soul. The will of God was carried out in his body on earth as well as in the heaven of his soul. Neither hunger nor wild beasts did harm to his body throughout the many years that he spent in the wilderness. His soul was harmed neither by despair in loneliness nor by pride in heavenly visions. He sought neither bread nor knowledge from man. God granted him everything that was necessary for him, because he gave himself up completely to the will of God.

He directed his footsteps neither into the wilderness nor away from the wilderness. An invisible rudder from on high steered his life. For when it was necessary for him to depart from the wilderness and go out to meet the Lord, it is said: The word of God came unto John (Luke 3:2). Like an innocent youth, John spoke simply about his communication with the powers of heaven: And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God (John 1:33-34). How tenderly and simply he speaks about heavenly things! How terrifying like a lion he is when he speaks out against the injustice of men, against Herod and Herodias! The lamb and the lion dwell in him together. Heaven is as close to him as a mother is to her child. The will of God is as accessible and clear to him as it is to the angels in heaven.

O Lord, most wise, direct the lives of us sinners in the wilderness of this life according to Thy will, as Thou didst direct the life of St. John the Baptist.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
